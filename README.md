# Job Search Platform

> **Important Note**: While this project was originally intended to be deployed to a cloud platform, some features encountered compatibility issues during cloud deployment. As a result, I've provided this comprehensive documentation and codebase for review purposes. The project runs perfectly in a local development environment, demonstrating all intended functionalities and architectural decisions. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause .

1. **MongoDB Connection Issues**
   - Problem: Intermittent database connection drops
   - Solution: Implemented connection retry mechanism and error handling

2. **File Upload**
   - Problem: Timeout issues with large file uploads
   - Solution: Added file size restrictions with Multer and frontend file validation

3. **State Management**
   - Problem: Managing complex filter and search states
   - Solution: Centralized state management using custom hooks and context API

4. **Performance**
   - Problem: Performance issues with large lists
   - Solution: Implemented pagination and lazy loading
